A web-based deep learning project that detects multiple eye disease categories from uploaded eye images. The application uses a trained image classification model and a Flask interface to help users upload an image, answer symptom-related questions, and view a predicted disease class with supporting information.

## Problem Statement

Eye diseases such as cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other retinal abnormalities can lead to severe vision loss when they are not detected early. Traditional screening depends heavily on manual examination by trained specialists, which can be time-consuming and less accessible in areas with limited ophthalmic resources.

This project addresses that problem by building a machine-learning-assisted web application that can analyze an uploaded eye image and predict the most likely disease class. The goal is to support early awareness, faster screening workflows, and more accessible preliminary eye-health assessment.

---

## Project Overview

The system accepts an eye image through a Flask-based web interface. The uploaded image is resized, normalized, and passed to a trained deep learning model. The model predicts one of the supported classes and returns the result along with a short disease description and user symptom inputs.

### High-Level Workflow

## Disease Classes

The current application supports the following prediction classes:

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| Cataract | Clouding of the eye lens that may cause blurred or foggy vision. |
| Diabetic Retinopathy | Diabetes-related retinal damage caused by changes in blood vessels. |
| Glaucoma | A group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve and may cause vision loss. |
| Normal | Indicates that no supported disease signs were detected by the model. |
| Other | Represents eye conditions outside the main trained categories. |

---

## Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline for medical image classification.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Dataset Collection] --> B[Image Resizing]
    B --> C[Data Normalization]
    C --> D[Data Augmentation]
    D --> E[Train-Test Split]
    E --> F[Transfer Learning Model]
    F --> G[Model Training]
    G --> H[Model Evaluation]
    H --> I[Save model.h5]
    I --> J[Flask Web Integration]
    J --> K[Prediction UI]
```

### 1. Data Collection

Eye image datasets are collected and organized into class-specific folders. The project report discusses public datasets used in ophthalmic research, such as datasets for retinal images, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, glaucoma, eye infections, and dry-eye-related conditions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Before training and prediction, images are converted into a consistent format:

- Resize input images to `256 x 256` pixels.
- Convert images into numerical arrays.
- Normalize pixel values by scaling them between `0` and `1`.
- Apply augmentation during training to improve generalization.

### 3. Model Training

The model training script uses transfer learning with **MobileNetV2** as the base model. The base model extracts image features, followed by additional dense layers for multi-class classification.

### 4. Prediction

During prediction, the uploaded image is preprocessed in the same format used during training. The model outputs probabilities for each class, and the class with the highest probability is selected as the final prediction.

## Model Architecture

The project uses a CNN-based image classification approach with transfer learning.

![CNN Model](cnn_model.png)

### Architecture Used

```text
Input Image: 256 x 256 x 3
        |
MobileNetV2 Base Model
        |
Global Average Pooling
        |
Dense Layer: 256 neurons, ReLU
        |
Dropout: 0.5
        |
Output Layer: 5 neurons, Softmax
```

The softmax output layer produces probabilities for the five supported disease classes.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/22f2000834/Multiple-eye-disease-detection-using-machine-learning.git
cd Multiple-eye-disease-detection-using-machine-learning
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

If a `requirements.txt` file is available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, install the main dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install flask tensorflow pillow numpy opencv-python
```

### 4. Add the Trained Model

Place your trained model file in the project directory:

```text
model.h5
```

Then update the `model_path` inside `app.py` if required:

```python
model_path = "model.h5"
```

> The current code may contain an absolute local path. For portability on GitHub, use a relative path such as `model.h5`.

Example training visualization format:

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Model Training Progress"
    x-axis "Epoch" [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    y-axis "Accuracy" 0 --> 1
    line "Training Accuracy" [0.62, 0.70, 0.78, 0.84, 0.89]

## Limitations

- The model should not be used as a clinical decision system.
- Prediction quality depends on dataset size, image quality, class balance, and training methodology.
- The current model supports only the trained disease categories.
- A larger clinically validated dataset is required for real-world medical reliability.
- The project currently runs as a local Flask prototype.

---

## Future Scope

- Add a verified performance report with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Improve dataset quality and class balance.
- Add Grad-CAM or heatmap visualization to explain model predictions.
- Deploy the application on Render, Railway, AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- Add user authentication and screening history.
- Support more eye disease classes.
- Add multilingual patient-friendly result explanations.
- Integrate a doctor/admin dashboard for reviewing uploaded cases.
